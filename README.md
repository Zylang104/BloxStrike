# Spectre Strike Edition
A roblox executor script for blox strike, a new cs2 copy game (honestly better then defuse division), this script it's still in beta and needs to be fixed whit some things 
so expect some bugs. For at least me this script it's not detected but i can't guarantee it won't be on future. It has Esp whit many options like skeleton, 2d box, alive check, highlight (glow effect like), name esp and health bar. Then for aimbot it's like an usual aimbot so smoothing, fov, wallcheck and more (misses predicition soon i will add it). Now the interisting part: it has a fov changer (it makes the fov the same as the fov changer soon i will fix it), fullbright, anti aim (broken will fix it), in the future sky changer and
### skin changer and glove changer
(knife changer soon but it's way harder), you basically have any glove and skin however you can only see it.
